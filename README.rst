iment-cli
=========

*A command line program for managing images in Python.*

Much inspired by the `beets <https://github.com/beetbox/beets>`_ approch.

Project template thanks to Randall Degges' `great article on CLI interfaces in
python <https://stormpath.com/blog/building-simple-cli-interfaces-in-python>`_

Purpose
-------

Frustrated with all the existing image management tools out there and desperatly
wantting a way to unify all the various image collections I have all over the
place I needed a way to deal with the growing chaos

I was inspired by the beets project that takes management of a large set of files
seriously. The idea being that the size of the data is becoming so big that
managing all the images, even with a GUI is becomeing too difficult and that is
where the command line shines: batch operations.

Objectives
----------

- Cataloge all the locations, local and online, of all ones images.
- Allow one to move, tag, manipulate some or all of the images with various commands.
- Consolidate all the images in one location local or in the cloud.
- Perhaps make it easy to publish or steam the library in various ways.


Usage
